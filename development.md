# Development notes

This project will loosely follow the development protocol
outlined in the [Numpy/scipy dev documentation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/dev/)

## Tools

To do development you will need your own computer with the following installed

- The `git` change control tool suite.
- A good code editor like visual studio `code` or `sublime`.
- Python with related libraries (it is best to override any system Python).
- The R command line tool.

You will also need

- A `github` login set up to authenticate from your computer.
- Your own github fork of the repository.
- A clone of your fork of the repository in your computer.

## Process

Run this command to follow an upstream branch:

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/simonsfoundation/inferelator_ng.git`

And to pull the code:

`git pull upstream master`
